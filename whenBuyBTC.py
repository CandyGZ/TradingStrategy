# Once you have a trading algorithm implemented, you will certainly want to test it to see if it can actually produce a
# profit and compare its performace with other strategies. Often, the first way to do this is to perform a backtest.
# The core idea behind a backtest is to simulate running your trading algorithm on historical data and compute several
#  metrics, such as the return. While this method certainly does not guarantee that the algorithmn will be consistently
# profitable, it's a quick way to test the viability of a strategy and reject clearly unfeasable strategies.
# Let's do a simple backtest over the 2020 BTC-USD data on the trading algorithm we implemented.
# There are many libraries that can perform sophisticated backtests on a variety of algorithms,
# however, to develop an understanding of the underlying principle, let's implement our own simple backtest.
# Let's suppose we start with an account with $1000 USD.
# Define how much money you will start with (in USD)
initial_balance = 159000

# Create dataframe containing all the dates considered
backtest = pd.DataFrame(index=trade_signals.index)

# Add column containing the daily percent returns of BTC
backtest["BTC_Return"] = BTC_USD["Close"] / BTC_USD["Close"].shift(
    1
)  # Current closing price / yesterday's closing price

# Now to compute the daily returns of the trading algorithm, let's assume that at any given point,
# our portfolio is either all in on BTC or is entirely holding USD. This means that whenever
# the algorithm is currently holding BTC, it's daily returns are the same as the daily returns of BTC.
# On the other hand, when the algorithm is holding USD, its returns are entirely detached from BTC price movements.
# Thus when holding USD, the value of the portfolio remains constant during that period. We will also make the simplifying
# assumption that we are able to perform zero comission trades. This reasoning is condensed into the following two lines of code.

# Add column containing the daily percent returns of the Moving Average Crossover strategy
backtest["Alg_Return"] = np.where(trade_signals.Signal == 1, backtest.BTC_Return, 1.0)

# Add column containing the daily value of the portfolio using the Crossover strategy

    initial_balance * backtest.Alg_Return.cumprod()
